(node:7776) DeprecationWarning: Mongoose: mpromise (mongoose's default promise library)
is deprecated, plug in your own promise library instead:
http://mongoosejs.com/docs/promises.html

Solution:
The problem was that there was a typo. Look at all the fields of the data to be stored
in database everywhere they are used (in model, addUser, ...). No need to add this part
which I found on the Internet:
MONGOOSE.Promise = global.Promise;
to be added before connection

Unknown authentication strategy &quot;jwt&quot;
The passport file and require('./config/passport')(PASSPORT); have been in comments

unauthorized router:
try console.log(jwt_payload) in passport file to see how you can get the id (_doc._id).
